# Configuration file for QA tests
# This file should be a valid python file.
# To test if format is correct, tye:
# python testconf.qa
# no output is produced if the code is correct
#
# The general format is:
#     variable = value
# There are few top-level variables: Binned and UnBinned for
# binned and unbinned distributions respectively.
# The value of the top-level variables is a dictionary of variable:values pairs.
# See the following as an example

#Configuration for un-binned distributions
#Describing only differences w.r.t. Binned case
#Unbinned distributions are stored in TTrees as the
#content of different branches.
#Only simple data in branches are supported (see examples)
TreeName = 'Craneen__Mu'
Binned = {
    #Define the Test to be executed by Default
    #If a test is specified for a specific histogram the latter will overwrite this
    #Availble tests are defined in module: StatTest.Tests, there the function
    # getTestByName is used to retrieve the test class corresponding to the name
    #Specified here
    'DefaultTestName' : 'Binned1DChi2Test',
    #Define the default thresholds for the test.
    #These are used together with the test above
    #Three special cases could be useful in special cases
    # If Thresholds : [ 0 , 0 ] It will cause the test to always PASS (basically disabble test)
    # If Thresholds : [ 0 , 1 ] Test will always be NOTPASSED (useful to force user to check results manually)
    # If Thresholds : [ 1 , 1 ] Test will always FAIL
    'DefaultThresholds' : [ 0.1,0.5],

    #Define the default file from where retrieve the reference histograms.
    #Reference histograms should have the same name (including ROOT's directory structure)
    #of the tested histogram.
    #Reference file is searched in working directory
    #'DefaultReferenceFile' : 'reference.root',
    #It is possible to access remote files via HHTP (See documentation of ROOT's TWebFile'
    #'DefaultReferenceFile' : 'http://someserver.org/somerootfile.root',

    #Define inputs: histograms a list of dictionaries
    'Histos' : [
        #Each dictionary represents a configuration for a set of histograms.
        #At least one configuration should be defined.
